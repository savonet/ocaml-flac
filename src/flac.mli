type audio_buffer = (float, Bigarray.float32_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t

(** Decode native FLAC data *)
module Decoder : sig
  (** {3 Usage} *)

  (** A typical use of the FLAC decoder is the following:
    *
    * {v  (* Raise this when streams has ended. *)
    * exception End_of_stream
    * (* Define a read function *)
    * let input = (..a function of type read..) in
    * (* Define a write function *)
    * let output = (..a function of type write..) in
    * (* Create callbacks *)
    * let callbacks = Flac.Decoder.get_callbacks input write in
    * (* Create an unitialized decoder *)
    * let decoder = Flac.Decoder.create callbacks in
    * (* Initialize decoder *)
    * let decoder,info,comments = Flac.Decoder.init decoder callbacks in
    * (..do something with info and comments..)
    * (* Decode data *)
    * match Flac.Decoder.state decoder c with
    *   | `Search_for_metadata
    *   | `Read_metadata
    *   | `Search_for_frame_sync
    *   | `Read_frame ->
    *         Flac.Decoder.process decoder callbacks
    *   | _ -> raise End_of_stream v}
    *
    * Some remarks: 
    * - Exceptions raised by callbacks should be treated
    *   as fatal errors. The dehaviour of the flac library 
    *   after being interrupted by an exception is unknown.
    *   The only notable exception is Ogg/flac decoding, where
    *   the read callback raises [Ogg.Not_enough_data].
    * - The state of the decoder should be checked prior to calling
    *   [process]. Termination may not be detected nor raise an
    *   exception so it is the caller's responsibility to check
    *   on this. 
    * - See FLAC documentation for the information on the 
    *   callbacks. 
    * - The variant type for decoder and callbacks is used
    *   to make sure that different type of decoders 
    *   (generic, file, ogg) are only used with the same
    *   type of callbacks. *)

  (** {3 Exceptions } *)

  (** An error in the stream caused the decoder to lose synchronization. *)

  (** {3 Functions} *)

  (** Create a set of callbacks. *)
  val get_callbacks :
    ?seek:(int64 -> unit) ->
    ?tell:(unit -> int64) ->
    ?length:(unit -> int64) ->
    ?eof:(unit -> bool) ->
    read ->
    write ->
    generic callbacks

  (** Create an uninitialized decoder. *)
  val create : 'a callbacks -> 'a dec

  (** Initialize a decoder. The decoder will be used to decode
    * all metadata. Initial audio data shall be immediatly available
    * after this call. *)
  val init : 'a dec -> 'a callbacks -> 'a t * info * comments option

  (** Decode one frame of audio data. *)
  val process : 'a t -> 'a callbacks -> unit

  (** Flush the input and seek to an absolute sample.
    * Decoding will resume at the given sample. Note 
    * that because of this, the next write callback may 
    * contain a partial block.  The client must support seeking 
    * the input or this function will fail and return [false].  
    * Furthermore, if the decoder state is [`Seek_error]
    * then the decoder must be flushed or reset
    * before decoding can continue. *)
  val seek : 'a t -> 'a callbacks -> Int64.t -> bool

  (** Flush the stream input.
    *  The decoder's input buffer will be cleared and the state set to
    *  [`Search_for_frame_sync].  This will also turn
    *  off MD5 checking. *)
  val flush : 'a t -> 'a callbacks -> bool

  (** Reset the decoding process.
    *  The decoder's input buffer will be cleared and the state set to
    *  [`Search_for_metadata]. MD5 checking will be restored to its original
    *  setting.
    *
    *  If the decoder is seekable, the decoder will also attempt to seek to 
    *  the beginning of the stream. If this rewind fails, this function will 
    * return [false].  It follows that [reset] cannot be used when decoding 
    * from [stdin].
    *
    *  If the decoder is not seekable (i.e. no seek callback was provided) 
    *  it is the duty of the client to start feeding data from the beginning 
    *  of the stream on the next [process]. *)

(** Encode native FLAC data *)
module Encoder : sig
  (** {3 Usage} *)

  (** A typical use of the FLAC encoder is the following:
    * {v  (* A function to write encoded data *)
    * let write = (..a function of type write..) in
    * (* Create the encoding callbacks *)
    * let callbacks = Flac.Encoder.get_callbacks write in
    * (* Define the parameters and comments *)
    * let params = (..a value of type params ..) in
    * let comments = [("title","FLAC encoding example")] in
    * (* Create an encoder *)
    * let enc = Flac.Encoder.create ~comments params callbacks in
    * (* Encode data *)
    * let data = (..a value of type float array array.. in 
    *  Flac.Encoder.process enc callbacks data ;
    * (..repeat encoding process..)
    * (* Close encoder *)
    * Flac.Encoder.finish enc callbacks v}
    * 
    * Remarks: 
    * - Exceptions raised by the callbacks should be treated
    *   as fatal. The behaviour of the FLAC encoding library is
    *   unknown after interrupted by an exception.
    * - Encoded data should have the same number of channels as
    *   specified in encoder's parameters and the same number of
    *   samples in each channels. 
    * - See FLAC documentation for informations about the callbacks.
    *   Note in particular that some information about encoded data
    *   such as md5 sum and total samples are only written when a 
    *   [seek] callback is given. 
    * - Variant types for callbacks and encoder are used to make sure
    *   that different type of callbacks (generic, file, ogg) are always
    *   used with the corresponding decoder type. *)
